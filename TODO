- move TLS algo's etc to a JSON file like we do for SSH

- rewrite the templates to not be so ridicuously large for 10s of 1000s of results
  possibly do this by simply generating a JSON list of all the results and rewrite
  the templates that all the elements are built up via pure JS instead of generated HTML
